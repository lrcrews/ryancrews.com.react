        <p>
          With the latest interation of my blog there are many things that are a
          work-in-progress. If you are seeing this message then you ended up
          here before I have any (or all of the) pages set up. Congrats ðŸŽ‰
        </p>
        <p>
          Check back soon as things should be filling in nicely over the next
          couple of weeks!
