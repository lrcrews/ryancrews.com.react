        <p>
          With thin latest interation of my blog there are many things that are
          a work-in-progress. If you are seeing this message than you ended up
          here before I have any (or all of the) pages set up. Congrats ðŸŽ‰
        </p>
        <p>
          Check back soon as things should be filling in nicely over the next
          couple of weeks!
        </p>
      </main>
    </PageWrapper>
